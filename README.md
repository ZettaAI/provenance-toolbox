# provenance-tools
A set of basic utilities to standardize use of provenance files for pipeline documentation

When processing multiple connectomics datasets in parallel, keeping track of different contexts can be a challenge that slows down development and causes costly mistakes. [Cloud-volume's provenance files](https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume/wiki/Provenance-Files) are capable of tracking the required information, but these have seen limited application partially due to their high degree of flexibility. These tools are an attempt to provide standardized ways of interacting with provenance files to guide their use and instill a set of requirements to define "properly-documented" processing.
